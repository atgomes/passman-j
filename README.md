# Description #

PassManJ is an application to help you manage your accounts. It allows you to save and retrieve passwords securely using a master password.

## How it works ## 

It works by encrypting your passwords and securily storing them locally in a database file. You can then save this file in your computer, favourite cloud service or a usb drive.

## Version ##

This software is currently on version 1.0
